Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data. It is applied in speech recognition, autonomous driving, and image generation. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular for building deep learning models. Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning requires large datasets and high computational power. Organizations are increasingly using deep learning for AI applications.
