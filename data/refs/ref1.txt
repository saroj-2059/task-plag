Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and improve performance over time. It is applied in image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics. Algorithms like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning help solve real-world problems. Companies use machine learning to optimize operations, automate tasks, and gain insights from large datasets.
